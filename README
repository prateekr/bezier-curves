Code runs on Mac OSX.

The source code is in the same directory as this file.
Simply type make clean and then type make.

To run, use as following:

./main file_name precision [-a | -o file_name]

where the command to run is as specified in the specs. -a is the optional flag for adaptive tessellation.
Likewise, we did the extra credit of outputting to a .OBJ file. As specified in the specs, pass in the parameters:

-o file_name

with file_name after -o and it will output as appropriately. Included in the submission is a sample .OBJ file
outputted by our program.
