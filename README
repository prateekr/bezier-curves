Code runs on Mac OSX.

The source code is in the same directory as this file.
Simply type make clean and then type make.
(Note: It is configured to machine so some reloading of libraries may be necessary for other machines)

To run, use as following:

./main file_name precision [-a | -o file_name]

where the command to run is as specified in the specs. -a is the optional flag for adaptive tessellation.
Likewise, we did the extra credit of outputting to a .OBJ file. As specified in the specs, pass in the parameters:

-o file_name

with file_name after -o and it will output as appropriately. Included in the submission is a sample .OBJ file
outputted by our program.

To verify that our generated OBJ file is correct, we uploaded it to a site that renders (http://webgl-tests.crbs.ucsd.edu/obj-viewer/).
